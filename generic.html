									<h1>The Members of the Order</h1>
								</header>
								<p>Through the course of its history the Order has always been headed by an Annalist. The Annalist is the one who keeps the historic records of the Order, and ensures they remain true to the records of the past. Assisting the Annalist in this goal are all manner of elevated Knights that range the spectrum of actions and activities. The core of the Order has, and always will be, the Knights of the Grave that serve the Light foremost. Frequently the Order has brought in those lacking in Faith and Vigor in the form of Penitents. Many such Penitents have gone on to redeem themselves in the Light’s grace through service. Those that survive such redemption are fully welcomed into the familial nature of the Order. The current members of the Order and their ranks are listed below.</p>

										<h3>Ruskin Blackemore</h3>
										<p>
											There's a fleeting glint of mischief in the eyes of the man before you. His mannerisms are a bit rough and he often seems to have a crooked grin on his face. Ruskin Blackemore usually seems at ease, even in dire situations. He's quick to quip, and often raises the hackles of others with his somewhat carefree attitude. Despite this outter calm, he cares for his Brothers and Sisters, and often worries for their safety.

								<h1>The Oath of the Grave</h1>
								<p>“I swear to uphold the Oath of the Grave. I swear that Death shall not be taken lightly, ending a life before it is right will prevent that life from getting its fair judgement. I swear that Death is a transition to another existence, and the physical forms of the dead should be properly interred and laid to rest- be that in the earth or by blessed flame. All remains are sacrosanct and demand respect. I hold faith that The undead are a blight and a perversion of the natural order. They must be eradicated for the greater good of all living beings. Those that manipulate the powers of undeath will meet a swift and just end. I promise that there should be no reason to fear death, as it is simply a transition to a realm appropriate for one’s true self. I abide that relics of great power shall not fall into the hands of the unjust, and that those creatures of ill intent that seek to harm the balance must be met with swift and vigorous punishment. I see to the fact that should I come into possession of such Light blessed items, or items cursed by ruinous powers, that I must treat them with sacrosanct respect to ensure their sanctity and protection no matter the cause. Destruction of ancient relics is a grave offence, and I swear to uphold the protection of such items no matter the cause. I swear all these things upon my Oath as a Knight of the Grave, and that my Oath binds me to such a cause until Death itself decrees that I am to be taken into its embrace. I do all of this with no reservations in my heart, and no worry in my mind. May this Oath keep until my dying breath. “

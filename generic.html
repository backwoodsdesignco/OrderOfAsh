									<h1>The Members of the Order</h1>
								</header>
								<p>Through the course of its history the Order has always been headed by an Annalist. The Annalist is the one who keeps the historic records of the Order, and ensures they remain true to the records of the past. Assisting the Annalist in this goal are all manner of elevated Knights that range the spectrum of actions and activities. The core of the Order has, and always will be, the Knights of the Grave that serve the Light foremost. Frequently the Order has brought in those lacking in Faith and Vigor in the form of Penitents. Many such Penitents have gone on to redeem themselves in the Light’s grace through service. Those that survive such redemption are fully welcomed into the familial nature of the Order. The current members of the Order and their ranks are listed below.</p>
								
								<h2>Annalist</h2>
								
								
									<div class="column">
										<span class="image left special"><img src="images/charles.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>Charles Schacktorn</h3>
										<p>
											The man is as grim and mysterious as they come. The Annalist of the Order has lead for man years, but his strange nature and even stranger habits remain the talk of the Order. Rarely is his face revealed from the masked helm so often worn by the man. His very aura is a strange one of conflicting magics. Both the Light and the Arcane can be felt in him strongly. Whatever his purpose, though... He leads the Order as their heart and their history alike. His guiding hand firm as it directs those new Knights under him to their place within the Order. 
										</p>
									</div>
									
								
								
								
								<br>
								
								<h2>Sacristan</h2>
								
								
									<div class="column">
										<span class="image left special"><img src="images/radhan.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>Radhan Ar'nareth</h3>
										<p>
											Dredged from only the dustiest topographies of time, Radhan occupies a position as the Order’s quartermaster, relic-duster, paper-pusher, and whatever else the Annalist abstains from taking care of. As a Quel’dorei of venerable age, it’s often questionable whether or not a given artifact is older than his long-trodden lifespan, earning him the often-dubbed epithet, ‘Relic’. When not on the campaign trail, he is typically lost in the Order’s labyrinthian vaults.
										</p>
									</div>

								<h2>Custodes</h2>
								<section class="columns double">
									<div class="column">
										<span class="image left special"><img src="images/carlisle.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>Carlisle Lanris</h3>
										<p>
											Dedication. A word that defines the huntsman. Some would use the term zeal and they would not be mistaken. It means the same thing after all. But with zeal comes a certain level of fanaticism. Calling Carlisle Lanris a fanatic almost seems cheap. He is a pious man, true. But he is of a tempered faith. Born and bred, raised, trained under the principles of the Church of the Holy Light. The huntsman is a testament to the Lights doctrine. He is Inexorable in his drive to cleanse the world of the impure. He shall never waver.
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="column">
										<span class="image left special"><img src="images/ruskin.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>Ruskin Blackemore</h3>
										<p>
											There's a fleeting glint of mischief in the eyes of the man before you. His mannerisms are a bit rough and he often seems to have a crooked grin on his face. Ruskin Blackemore usually seems at ease, even in dire situations. He's quick to quip, and often raises the hackles of others with his somewhat carefree attitude. Despite this outer calm, he cares for his Brothers and Sisters, and often worries for their safety.
										</p>
									</div>
									
									<div class="column">
										<span class="image left special"><img src="images/sif.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>Siphiah Dawnbane</h3>
										<p>
											Known formally by her Silver Hand title—The Justiciar—Siphiah serves as a Grave Warden of the Order, and a stalwart presence on its front line. Few could doubt her effectiveness on the field, which is best described as a mixture of brute force and blunt diplomacy. Her history is a complex matter: a case of outcast nobility, blurred allegiances, and bad blood. The shadows of wars past seem to darken her step, and cast her figure in a fair amount of mystery.
										</p>
									</div>
								</section>
								<h2>Grave Wardens</h2>
								<section class="columns double">
									<div class="column">
										<span class="image left special"><img src="images/forskare2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>Anna Forskare</h3>
										<p>
											A devoted servant of the Light. Few match her zeal and fervor when she gets started. She ensures loyalty and cause in the Order. Her watchful eyes are always there, always lingering. Her senses attuned to slip-ups in those Brothers and Sisters she watches. Her time in the Order is long, and her history with the Annalist even longer still.  There is no question to her deference to him, or to the purpose of the Order. There is mystery between the two of them that cannot exactly be pinned down. 
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="column">
										<span class="image left special"><img src="images/pup.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>Edgar Holden</h3>
										<p>
											A young and impressionable man with a keen eye for the right details. Though the Light may give and take his odd luck as it pleases, it is never uncertain to be the latest spark of his interest and desire to know enough.
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="column">
										<span class="image left special"><img src="images/amilia.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>Amilia Tervander</h3>
										<p>
											Paranoid yet personable once one gets to know her, Amilia Tervander is one for stealth and security of her comrades. Armed with arcane arrows and poisoned knives, this small, cat-like woman is quick to dispatch threats aimed at both the Order as well as that she calls, The Cycle.

								<h2>Torch Bearers</h2>

										<h3>Molly Sykes</h3>
										<p>
											Fuzzy Time.
										</p>
									</div>
									
							
									<div class="column">
										<span class="image left special"><img src="images/vie.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>Vie Hathens</h3>
										<p>
											One of the few people keeping the Order alive.
										</p>
									</div>
									
									<div class="column">
										<span class="image left special"><img src="images/beckwith.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>Beckwith Valdis</h3>
										<p>
											Once a Stormwind army medic and a Silver Hand executioner, now a practicing physician among the ranks of the Order. Adhering to traditional medicine with a touch of Light healing, she will always put the patient first, even if that means taking the blow in their stead. Preventative medicine is after all, in her opinion, the best medicine. She is available 24/7 for free medical consultations, mental health counseling, or stoking your gambling addiction with a game of cards. Health insurance not necessary.
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="column">
										<span class="image left special"><img src="images/illy.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>Illionna Sinlefel</h3>
										<p>
											Compassion Incarnate, but a fire that burnt to the core if need be, the Medic evened the scales. She walked in harmony with the Light, devout throughout her days, some say it coursed through her veins like rushing rivers. The essence of life was precious to her and she would always lend a hand to those in need, comrades and strangers alike. Formerly of the Silver Hand and a traveling Medic, her skills in mending even the worst wounds with the light were superb. Not to say she relied on it for everything, traditional medicine had its place as well. Dare say she was a bit of an alchemist too. She landed her way in the Order in quite dark moments, but she rises in the Light to aid all those she now holds dear. Her origin speaks of noble Gilnean roots, but a mystery looms within her and her heritage.

									<div class="column">
										<span class="image left special"><img src="images/sabine.png" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>Sabine Graham</h3>
										<p>
											Ruled by the Light, Sabine is an embodiment of its strength -  powerful enough to drown you, soft enough to cleanse you, and deep enough to save you. A wise woman who knows her limits - she has none. Her discipline is unrivaled, resilience being her truest strength.
She is determined and decisive, full of zeal and private passions that she shares only with those kept close. Gifted at birth with what she calls "The Sight", Sabine believes that she was chosen by the Light itself to do its will upon the world with an iron fist. Her sensitivity to the souls of the dying allows her incredible insight into the people and places around her. This gift has lead her into the title of Inquisitor, specializing in exorcisms, paranormal, and occult phenomena.
										</p>

									<div class="column">
										<span class="image left special"><img src="images/elle.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>Elle Motherfucker</h3>
										<p>
											A young and vibrant woman hailing from the noble houses of fallen Gilneas. With a keen eye for antique relics and a healthy fascination for the history of this world, Elle has found a comfortable niche for herself within the Order. Though she aspires to maintain a mundane role as archivist or historian, she does practice as a novice field medic and priestess of the Holy Light. Her kind hand and nurturing disposition is no doubt a far cry from the brash and mysterious nature of her allies, but more than often it is a welcomed one.

										<h3>Damian Martin </h3>
										<p>
											Damian is an average height Arathorian, a scar down the side of his face from combat with the Horde. He wears the pacifier of his deceased baby sister around his neck as a reminder to never forgive, or never forget. He also bakes bread!

										<h3>Damned Daniel</h3>
										<p>
											The best friend and worst enemy of the Order of Ash. Once a captive within Tol Barad's dungeons, he has since been let loose, either through self-imposed will or by virtue of call to action from the Purifier himself. No one is quite sure.

										<h3>Framemaker</h3>

										<h3>Lysa Duskgaze</h3>
										<p>
											There is no doubt the Kaldorei is a strange Ally for the Order of Zealous Light Worshippers. Even so, she has attached herself to the Order with some frequency. When matters intersect with the interests of the Circle she is the Order's point of contact. While hesitant to involve herself further, she has proven herself an Ally of the Order time and time again through their operations. In the end, their purposes are similar to ensuring the balance between Life and Death.

								<h1>The Oath of the Grave</h1>
								<p>“I swear to uphold the Oath of the Grave. I swear that Death shall not be taken lightly, ending a life before it is right will prevent that life from getting its fair judgement. I swear that Death is a transition to another existence, and the physical forms of the dead should be properly interred and laid to rest- be that in the earth or by blessed flame. All remains are sacrosanct and demand respect. I hold faith that The undead are a blight and a perversion of the natural order. They must be eradicated for the greater good of all living beings. Those that manipulate the powers of undeath will meet a swift and just end. I promise that there should be no reason to fear death, as it is simply a transition to a realm appropriate for one’s true self. I abide that relics of great power shall not fall into the hands of the unjust, and that those creatures of ill intent that seek to harm the balance must be met with swift and vigorous punishment. I see to the fact that should I come into possession of such Light blessed items, or items cursed by ruinous powers, that I must treat them with sacrosanct respect to ensure their sanctity and protection no matter the cause. Destruction of ancient relics is a grave offence, and I swear to uphold the protection of such items no matter the cause. I swear all these things upon my Oath as a Knight of the Grave, and that my Oath binds me to such a cause until Death itself decrees that I am to be taken into its embrace. I do all of this with no reservations in my heart, and no worry in my mind. May this Oath keep until my dying breath. “

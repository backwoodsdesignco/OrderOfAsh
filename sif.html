									<h2>Siphiah Dawnbane</h2>
									<h5>Custode &emsp; Elf &emsp; War Crimes Consultant &emsp;</h5>
									
									<h4>Known formally by her Silver Hand title—The Justiciar—Siphiah serves as a Grave Warden of the Order, and a stalwart presence on its front line. Few could doubt her effectiveness on the field, which is best described as a mixture of brute force and blunt diplomacy. Her history is a complex matter: a case of outcast nobility, blurred allegiances, and bad blood. The shadows of wars past seem to darken her step, and cast her figure in a fair amount of mystery.   </h4>

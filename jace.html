									<h2>Jacelynn Kindreth</h2>
									<h5>Knight of the Grave &emsp; Relic Sworn &emsp; Rat Wrangler &emsp;</h5>
									
									<h4>Known more for her skill with a scalpel and medical knowledge than her warm and welcoming demeanor. <br><Br>

The doctor was an oddity amongst the Order, having never wielded a sword prior to donning the tabard. She was trained by the best the Order had to offer in terms of swordplay which has proven vital to her survival in the often ‘kill or be killed’ nature of the Order’s work. <br> <br>

Dr. Kindreth has found a home amongst the faithful and tend to their wounds as they come, albeit with a sigh and furrowed brow. </h4>

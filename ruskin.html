									<h2>Ruskin Blackemore</h2>
									<h5>Custode &emsp; Worgem &emsp; Scout &emsp;</h5>
									
									<h4>There's a fleeting glint of mischief in the eyes of the man before you. His mannerisms are a bit rough and he often seems to have a crooked grin on his face. Ruskin Blackemore usually seems at ease, even in dire situations. He's quick to quip, and often raises the hackles of others with his somewhat carefree attitude. Despite this outer calm, he cares for his Brothers and Sisters, and often worries for their safety.   </h4>

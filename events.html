										<h3>MoonCatcher Retreats!</h3>
										<p>
											After several months of back and forth with the Order of Ash's forces and their allies and one last attempt to squash their forces, the death knight Mooncatcher has retreated to Icecrown to regain her strength. With the recent meeting between the Order's allies completed, the force will begin its march north to put an end to Catcher and her undead forces.
										</p>
										
										<p>
											Mooncatcher and other prominent death knights are part of the Order's latest Northrend-based campaign. Starting after the events of the Shattered Sky, the Order pursued leads on increased undead activity around the southern lands, culminating in their pursuit of a death knight by the name of MoonCatcher. After several months of operating out of Amberpine Lodge, the order has garnered enough support from the people of Northrend to march on their weakened enemy.

										<h3>The Wolf Cult Returns</h3>
										<p>
											After reports of unusual Vrykul activity in the southeast, the Order uncovered new signs of the Wolf Cult that previously plagued the residents of Grizzly Hills. Combined with the forces of the Vrykul, the cultists sought to spread the curse throughout friendly Alliance forces in the area.
										</p>
										
										<p>
											After fighting their way through ambushes, Order forces were able to destroy a majority of the cultist's forces and stop the ritual from completing. Though the day was won, the shaman behind the cult's actions is still at large...

										<h3>The End Of Sister</h3>
										<p>
											After receiving intel and the assistance of one of the death knight's former mages, Order forces were able to infiltrate a necropolis in order to bring down Sister, one of the death knights vying for power in the north after the events of the Shattered Sky. After sabotaging the necropolis itself, the Order was able to defeat Sister and narrowly escape before the floating fortress crashed from the sky.
										</p>
									
									<p>Sister and other prominent death knights are part of the Order's latest Northrend-based campaign. Starting after the events of the Shattered Sky, the Order pursued leads on increased undead activity around the southern lands, culminating in their pursuit of a death knight by the name of MoonCatcher. After learning of the struggle for power in the North, the Order moved to secure a foothold in the Grizzly Hills and has been fighting the undead menace since then.</p>

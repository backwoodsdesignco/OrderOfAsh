									<h2>Simone Dawnbane</h2>
									<h5>Knight of the Grave &emsp; Certified Rich Kid &emsp; Bane of Sif &emsp;</h5>
									
									<h4>An unexpected addition to the Order’s ranks, the younger Dawnbane sister left her sheltered life in Quel’thalas behind to seek purpose. Though a skilled mage, her inexperience in many worldly matters has kept her on the sidelines until recently; determined to prove her worth, she serves as both a diplomat and healer when need be, employing a gentle hand where most others would choose the sword. Though her connection to the Light is undeniable, she has much to learn about service, sacrifice, and the Oaths which keep them bound. </h4>

									<h2>Charles Schacktorn</h2>
									<h5>Annalist &emsp; Himbo &emsp; Fire Addict &emsp; Genuine Dick Sucker</h5>
									
									<h4>The man is as grim and mysterious as they come. The Annalist of the Order has lead for many years, but his strange nature and even stranger habits remain the talk of the Order. Rarely is his face revealed from the masked helm so often worn by the man. His very aura is a strange one of conflicting magics. Both the Light and the Arcane can be felt in him strongly. Whatever his purpose, though... He leads the Order as their heart and their history alike. His guiding hand firm as it directs those new Knights under him to their place within the Order. </h4>

									<h3>What is the Order Of Ash?</h3>
									<p>The Order of Ash is a heavy roleplaying guild based on Moonguard United States inside of World of Warcraft. The Order itself is a band of righteous light fueled militant zealots, knights and other hangers on that contribute to the Order. Our common themes can often be described as grimdark; dark and dreary fit the bill for our typical campaigns. We're somewhere in the middle ground that straddles the line between low fantasy and heroic high fantasy. We aren't heroes; the Order of Ash is just a motley crew of normal folks struggling to do the Light's work in the face of difficult odds. The Guild as a whole is focused on containment of dangerous Relics and Persons to ensure they are kept out of the wrong hands. </p>
									
									<p>The Guild has frequent roleplay events that occur multiple times a week, which contribute to long lasting and overarching campaigns. Those joining would find themselves thrust into unique and interesting storylines that fit properly into the World of Warcraft universe. Members are often given the responsibility and freedom to grow their characters as they see fit, with the Guild operating as a supporting element to help along that growth. Plenty of mentors and other characters exist to help bolster the development and learning of others that join. The Order enjoys a long term set of history and unique rituals that are slowly discovered in character as a member joins and ascends the ranks to Knighthood and above.  </p>
									
									<p>Roleplay events are frequent, and the Guild makes use of a uniquely adapted rolling system that is both lightweight and highly customizable. Every character has the opportunity to wield a Relic, a unique item recovered from the guild's many events, and to use its unique abilities in future missions.. The customizability exists to be a taunting front lined tank, a glass cannon pyromancer, and even a support-focused healer that works the back lines. The options are endless and easy to understand with only a small walkthrough. The system is balanced to ensure that everyone has an equal playing field when it comes to building up their character. No one has more advanced abilities or stats because of their rank within the guild.  </p>
									
									<p>Overall, the Guild has a rather specific theme that it follows when it comes to both Roleplay and Aesthetic. To that end it’s somewhat restricted on who and what can join the Guild. Primarily the Guild caters to those characters of a more faith-focused outlook. While those lacking in faith can join they will find themselves often looked on with some level of suspicion as they grow and develop. In addition, the Guild has a racial restriction when it comes to new characters. The Guild accepts Humans, Worgen, High Elves and Dwarves of all varieties. When it comes to classes the disallowed ones are Death Knight, Demon Hunter, Druid and Warlock. Druid and Warlock are permissible if they are flavored as a different class in character. Further exceptions do exist, but they are on an extreme case by case basis. </p>
									
									<p>Finally, it’s expected that those involved conduct themselves in a well meaning fashion both in character and out of character. Disagreements from an out of character view should be handled maturely to allow talking things out rather than allowing issues to fester and cause discomfort. When someone says to stop just stop, and use good judgement in the things you say and do.</p>

									<h3>The History of the Order</h3>
									
									<p>The Order of Ash is a historic and storied band of Knights and Archivists. It has appeared off and on through recorded history from before the opening of the Dark Portal. Often the Order has had the tendency to crop up and appear as if ghosts to complete some specific goal before vanishing once more into the annals of history for years to come. It is a nimble organization, often adapted and altered to better fit the circumstances presented against it. The guiding focus of the Order has always remained preservation and protection of items deemed in need of such. Historic items such as relics, artifacts, art and the written word are all valuable enough to merit the Order’s preservation and attention. In the same line the Order focuses upon preserving the balance between Life and Death. Time comes for all Individuals, and the Order works to ensure that this is respected both in the rites given and the preservation of those who have passed. The Order does its part by seeking out those that would threaten the balance and either capturing or killing them as necessary to prevent further loss of life. </p>
									
									<p>Through the course of its history the Order has always been headed by an Annalist. The Annalist is the one who keeps the historic records of the Order, and ensures they remain true to the records of the past. Assisting the Annalist in this goal are all manner of elevated Knights that range the spectrum of actions and activities. The core of the Order has, and always will be, the Knights of the Grave that serve the Light foremost. Frequently the Order has brought in those lacking in Faith and Vigor in the form of Penitents. Many such Penitents have gone on to redeem themselves in the Light’s grace through service. Those that survive such redemption are fully welcomed into the familial nature of the Order.</p>
									
									<p>In its current incarnation the Order is headed by the Annalist Charles Schacktorn. They have allied themselves with the Baradin Wardens and operate primarily out of Tol Barad thanks to their longstanding alliance with the Wardens. Despite calling the island their home, they are often abroad for campaigns elsewhere in Azeroth. The Order itself is not strictly beholden to the Alliance nor to the Church itself but, the outlooks and views of such organizations are often enough in alignment with that of the Order that they form frequent allies. While the Order does not take commands from the Church itself it does follow the Light to a critical degree, and have a patron Saint in the form of Averia the Burned Lady. These blendings of Faith form the core of the Order’s more stalwart and vigorous Knights. </p>
									
									<p>The Ascension from Scribe to elevated Knight is one fraught with learning and development. Any who come in are brought in at such a low rank and must prove themselves to their Brothers and Sisters. Those that manage to last and survive will be rewarded with power and boons to ensure their service to the Light continues. The deeper-mysteries of the Order are known by few, but those Knights that remain in service long enough slowly start to be brought further and further into the Annalist’s fold to uncover such secrets for themselves. </p>
